    <h6>Introduction</h6>
    <p>This article explains the process in which the Abh create anti-matter to power their ships and weapon systems.</p>

    <h6>Facilities</h6>
    <p>Not all star systems have collectors. In the Abl√Øarsec system, home to the Abh capital city, the Abh have constructed a spider-webbed system around the entire star. Each span is 50km in width. From a distance it looks like a fine mesh around the star, but in reality, it is the closest thing to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_Sphere">Dyson Sphere</a> in the universe. The bottom (star facing) side is covered in panels collecting anti-protons and converting them to anti-matter. It is the largest anti-matter production plant in the universe and is a testament to Abh engineering.</p>

    <h6>Uses</h6>
    <p>Anti-matter has two purposes for the Abh. It is used as fuel for their ships as well as for the warheads of Abh mines. Anti-matter is not pumped on ships like gas is pumped into a car, it is transfered into the ship aboard containers typically carried by two crew members. </p>

    <h6>Collection & Storage of the Anti-Protons</h6>
    <p>Most star systems controlled by the Abh have space stations, much like the Feubdach Territory station, which, among many other tasks, serve as a docking station for anti-matter collectors. In order to make a collector, the Abh hallow out a large and dense asteroid and construct a containment field inside the asteroid. This is cheaper than making a one from raw materials. On the side facing the star, is an array of 25 anti-proton collecting panels, that resemble solar panels. The nuclear fusion reaction within a star produced massive amounts of these anti-protons, which are collected and stored in a holding tank. When enough particles are collected, they are accelerated to near light speed in one of 16 tiny particle accelerators, and converted to anti-matter. This anti-matter is then stored inside the containment field inside the hallowed out asteroid. When a sufficient supply of anti-matter is produced, the collector will return to the station and unload the anti-matter into large storage tanks, which will be used to fuel ships docked at the station. An average solar system has hundreds or even thousands of collectors. For nobles without habitable planets, this is the only way to turn a profit from the territory. </p>

    <h6>Production of Anti-Matter</h6>
    <p>Anti-protons emitted from the star are collected and stored in holding tanks. One enough have been collected, they are accelerated to near light-speed in the particle accelerator. When in the particle accelerator they are slammed together with hydrogen atoms at extremely high speeds and converted into anti-matter. The process creates a bi-product of positively charged protons which are discarded into space. The anti-matter is then sent through to a containment field constructed inside of a hollowed out asteroid connected to the base of the collection unit and stored there.</p>

    <h6>Refueling</h6>
    <p>When a ship needs to refuel, the collection units are moved toward a fuel factory where the anti-matter is collected and sent to portable storage tanks that can be stored aboard a supply ship or in the factory until a ship needs to refuel. If its a small ship in a hurry, they can dock with the collector and refuel that way.</p>
    <p>After the anti-matter fuel has been extracted from the asteroid, the collector is sent back out to orbit the star and create more anti-matter. There is virtually no limit to how many collectors can roam a star system.</p>
