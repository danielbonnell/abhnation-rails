    <h6>Attack Ships (Gairh)</h6>
    <p>These ships are very maneuverable and can be deadly when used in large numbers. They are armed with an anti-proton cannon and 2 ion cannons used mostly for destroying enemy mines. However they must maneuver in packs of 6 or more because they don't have very strong shields or armor.</p>

    <h6>Imperial Battle Ship (Résic)</h6>
    <p>These ships carry a large complement of offensive mines and a number of high-power ion cannons. They are not as powerful as a patrol ship, but they are great for large scale mine attacks.</p>

    <h6>Patrol Ships (Laitec)</h6>
    <p>Patrol ships are the largest warships in the empire and are often the most advanced ships in all of inhabited space. They are extremely formidable, capable of launching up to 10 mines at the enemy. They are armed with 6 electromagnetic rail cannons, and 20 ion cannons on the sides, as well as 4 ion cannons at the bow of the ship. They have an extremely thick armored hull and the best shields. However there vulnerability is that they are slow and hard to maneuver in battle. A good example of their formidability is the Battle of the Gothlauth. Even when outnumbered 10 to 1, Laich still managed to destroy 9 enemy ships and damage the last before being destroyed.</p>

    <h6>Line-of-Battle Ships (Alaicec)</h6>
    <p>These ships are used as supply ships for fleet operations. They are the largest ships, some up to 10 miles in length, and carry thousands of mines which can be transfered to warships for use in combat. However, these ships can not use the mines themselves, as they lack the facilities on board to fuel, target, and launch the mines.</p>

    <h6>Attack Ships / Light Patrol Ships</h6>
    <p>These ships are first mentioned in Seikai no Senki and are a new development only entering production 3 years after the war first begun. They are a cross between an assault ship and a patrol ship. They have two electromagnetic cannons, an anti-proton cannons, and an unknown number of ion cannons. It isnot known if they can launch mines, but due to their size and combat role, this would seem unlikely.</p>

    <h6>Communication Ships (Longiac)</h6>
    <p>These are small vessels capable of Planer space flight. They seat 2 people, have no weapons, and are used for sending long range communications between fleets. The ship used by Lamhirh and Ghintec in Seikai no Monshou to get to the capital was a communications ship.</p>

    <h6>Transport Shuttle (Issazec)</h6>
    <p>These ships are used to transport military personnel. They seat 50 and are not capable of planer space flight. They are often used as life boats on larger ships. A good example is the Ciliqué-class ship used to take Ghintec to the Gothlauth in the second episode of Seikai no Monshou.</p>

    <h6>Large-Scale Transport Ships (lussomiac)</h6>
    <p>These ships are like Line-of-Battle ships, but rather than carrying mines, they carry replacement parts for ships, as well as medical supplies, food, anti-matter feul, and other items. Some Abh live on these ships with their children and pets, as they did in the early days of the Empire. This is only allowed because these ships do not participate in combat.</p>
