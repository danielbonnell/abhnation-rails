    <h6>Introduction</h6>
    The following is a comprehensive list of character profiles for the Abh
    that have appeared in the animated version of the Seikai series. Characters
    are classified by their genetic race, not by their legal status. While
    Jinto is legally an Abh, he is not a genetic Abh, and thus is not included
    on this page.

    <p>Ghintec is originally from a planet called Martine. When he was 8 years old, the Abh took control of his home world and his father Rock Linn, the president, sold out to the Abh and became the leader of Martine. Since Ghintec was Rock's son, he was next in line for Rock's position as Nobleman. Ghintec was sent of to the planet Derctuh to learn Baronh and Abh customs before traveling to the capitol to attend a military academy and become a Supply Officer aboard the Basrogrh. Ghintec has served aboard the Basrogrh since then. When the war broke out, his home world joined the side of the United Mankind, but was later recaptured by the Abh. Ghintec chartered a treaty between Martine and the Abh, which would give the people control over the government. In doing so, Ghintec sacrificed his powers and his ability to ever return home without renouncing his title and Abh citizenship. Ghintec is about 6 feet tall, has brown eyes, and is a shy person. He is very attracted to Lamhirh but is too sheepish to admit it. This is evident throughout the anime and novels.</p>
