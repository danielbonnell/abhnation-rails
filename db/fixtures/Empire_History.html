    <h6>The Great Migration</h6>
    <p>Although the exact time is not known, it is likely around the mid or later half of the 22nd century AD that humans first discovered the Yuanon particles, orbiting in close proximity to the sun. By the end of the 21st century, the Earth had become vastly overpopulated, and humanity sought a way to colonize space. No one knew what the Yuanon particle was when it was first discovered. Some theorized it was a white hole, or a tear between two different universes. None-the-less, research commenced on this photon-sized particle which radiated a whopping 500 megawatts of energy. After much research and trial and error, humans eventually learned to use these particles to power intersteller colony ships through space, and begun the process of colonizing space. Many nations sent explorers and colonists to the stars. Some made the journey successfully, others failed. Still others were never heard from again. It may never be known how many ships left the solar system for other star systems. This is the period that is known as the Great Migration, when humanity suddenly colonized the galaxy.</p>

    <h6>The Mother Space City</h6>
    <p>In this time period, a radical group of colonist left the Earth from an unnamed archipelago of islands in southeast Asia. Their goal was to preserve their culture in space, where other nations could not interfere. These settlers were from the not so distant future Japan. The settlers on the mother space city wanted to explore space though, but were not willing to go themselves, on the life long journey and endure tremendous pressures, so they engineered 30 super human slaves to explore space for them. These super humans could withstand rapid accelerations that would kill any human, and were built for the life in space. They also possessed an extra sensory organ to help them navigate on their journey. There were originally 30 of these slaves created. Their blue hair separated them from the humans. During a training exercise, shortly before they were scheduled to depart on their mission of exploration, one of the slaves was killed in an accident. The remaining 29 were sent off shortly after, and later became the ancestors of the Abh.</p>
    <p>The Abh however, grew tired of being slaves to the mother space city, and realized they could live on their own, so they broke off all ties with the mother space city. But this was not good enough. The Abh constantly lived with the fear that the mother space city would send a disciplinary force to punish the Abh for their disobedience. As the Abh population grew, they were forced to build more ships and acquire more Yuanons to power their ships, but this fear still haunted them. The Abh launched a surprise attack on the mother space city, which was defenseless and easily destroyed.</p>
    <p>It is said that every Abh will carry the guilt of destroying the mother space city on one shoulder, and the duty to carry on the mother space city's culture on the other shoulder. To the Abh, this is the meaning of their existence. Any reference to this event will not be found in the written records, as it has been passed down through oral tradition, and the Abh rarely speak about it in public.</p>

    <h6>The Wandering Period</h6>
    <p>After the mother space city had been destroyed, and for some time prior to that event, the Abh were nomadic traders. They traveled from one star system to the next to trade. It is very possible that this interaction with other cultures impacted their own cultural development. The Abh continued as nomadic traders for many hundreds of years before discovering planar space. With the discovery of planar space, the Abh were now able to travel vast distances in short amounts of time, and so established the empire in Imperial Year 1.</p>

    <p>*Spelling of Family Name conflicts with established canon. It is possible these are the original spellings, and the canon spelling of the names is the version that evolved over 950+ years, however that is just speculation.</p>
    <p>As you may have noticed, the kingdom name does not appear in Abh names. The 29 people aboard the colony ship Ablïarsec, which served as The Abh's home before the empire was formed, founded the empire with 29 families, each of which specialized in a different area of expertise.. Later the Ablïarsec became the center of the Abh capital, Lacmhacarh. Ablïarsec is the royal family's clan, Lamhirh's clan. They are the only Abhs allowed to have pointed ears. The eight royal families are part of the 29 founding families, and each family rules over one of the eight kingdoms that form the empire.</p>

    <h6>Imperial Conquest</h6>
    <p>With the establishment of the empire, the Abh began taking over planets so the could control interstellar trading rights. Contact between people on different worlds was limited due to the great distance between stars. The Abh, over the course of the next 950 years came to control over half of the galaxy, while the other half was controlled by various human nations. The Abh knew that by controlling the planets and restricting access to faster-than-light travel, they could maintain trading rights and prevent an otherwise inevitable interstellar war between humanity.</p>

    <h6>Territorial Claims</h6>
    <p>As of Imperial Year 956, the empire controls over 1,500 inhabited star systems, and 20,000 partially inhabited star systems. Inhabited star systems have planets in them that are colonized, partially inhabited star systems, like the Feubdach Barony only have small outposts manned by only a handful of people. The Abh control many more uninhabited star systems as well. In total, the Abh control about one half of the Milky Waygalaxy, and rule over 960 billion humans, just slightly under half of the 2 trillion humans that populate the Milky Way.</p>
