    <h6>The Human Kind Empire of Abh (Frybaréc Glœr Gor Bari)</h6>
    <p>The largest of the 5 nations, it controls over 25,000 inhabited star systems and is the most powerful. Sense keeping a number of planets united is difficult, the Abh have adopted a policy of allowing human populations under their rule to continue living their life style while only imposing limitations on the development and use of ships capable of plane space travel. More information on the Abh culture and empire can be found throughout the rest of this site.</p>

    <h6>The United Mankind</h6>
    <p>The United Mankind is a member of the Four Nations Alliance and controls the most inhabited star systems of all the nations, only next to the Abh Empire. They force their culture onto the people of the worlds they control. They do this through heavy trade. The primary reason why Samsonn's planet allied itself with the empire was so the people could keep their culture and way of life, in particular, their eating habits.</p>

    <h6>The Federation of Hania</h6>
    <p>The federation planets share very similar cultures, which have enabled them to unite with ease, yet there are still a few planets with vastly different cultures. This is the last of the interstellar nations. This nation is a member of the Nova Sicily Treaty Organization and a Four Nations Alliance member; however, they are neutral in the conflict between the Four Nations Alliance and the empire. While they are allied to the other nations, they did not declare war on the empire so they are therefore neutral.</p>

    <h6>Nation Hyde (Haïder)</h6>
    <p>Nation Hyde, also known as Martine (Ghintec's home world) is a lush and fertile planet with abundant and exotic wild life, and vast oceans. It is one of the few planets inhabited by Humans that was not terraformed. The planet has a population of about 10 million people, who all live in one city on the surface. The city is composed of three enormous composite buildings that are interlinked, surrounded by several smaller composite buildings. All the buildings are interconnected and are powered by nuclear fusion. The planet has a sophisticated network of defense satellites as well as 20 ground based missile batteries for defense. The inhabitants left their original colony ship, the Leif Erickson, in orbit as a museum. When the Abh conquered Martine Rock Lin was appointed as Earl, a choice he would later regret when the people of Martine executed him and joined the United Mankind. The Martinese language is a derivative of ancient English. Not much else is known about Martine.</p>

    <h6>Nation Safugnoff (Sfagnaumh)</h6>
    <p>Nation Sfagnaumh is a planetary system, that by means of plane space, is in close proximity to the Abh capital. There is one inhabited planet in this system, Clasbul. Clasbul has a population of more than 50 million people and the society is much like American society. The people speak English, so it is likely that the planet was settled by humans who came from the United States. The United Mankind in a surprise attack ceased Clasbul, however after suffering heavy losses, the Abh were able to drive them back and recapture the planet.</p>
