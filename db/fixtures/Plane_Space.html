    <h6>Introduction</h6>
    <p>The planar universe is what makes the Seikai series possible. Plane space is to Seikai, what Warp Drive is to Star Trek. This article will define important concepts and explain the fundamentals of how plane space travel works. I will also delve into some theoretical astrophysics to help explain some of the concepts, however I will keep the article simple enough so as to make for an enjoyable read. </p>

    <h6>Important Terminology </h6>
    <p>In order to understand the concept behind the planar universe, it is helpful to understand some technical terms which will be used heavily in this article.</p>
    <p>
      Planar (Fath): Referring to a plane, or "flat" surface for lack of a better term.
      Normal Space (Dadh): Refering to the four dimensional universe containing planets, stars, and galaxies.
      <br />
      <b>Gateway (Sord Loeza):</b> Refers to the point of entry or exit to or from the planar universe.
      <br />
      <b>Yuanon (Sord Gulark):</b> Theoretical particle capable or producing massive quantities of energy.
      <br />
      <b>X Particle:</b> The term I will use to refer the proton-sized particles that exist in plane space.
    </p>
    <p>For the sake of not confusing the readers, I will not use Abh terminology in this article except when defining a term, I will give the Abh word.</p>

    <h6>Background Information </h6>
    <p>In th 20th century, Albert Einstein formulated the famous theory of relativity, which among other things, states that it was impossible to exceed the speed of light, or to go faster than 185,000 miles per second. As an object, like a ship, gains momentum, it gains mass. The more massive (or heavier) an object becomes, the more fuel it requires to continue accelerating. This energy need increases exponentially as an object moves faster and faster, to a point where it would require more energy than is produced in the entire universe, to go faster than the speed of light.</p>
    <p>Since it is not possible to create and contain such energy, it is not possible to accelerate an object faster than the speed of light. In addition to this, as an object gains momentum, time relative to the occupants would slow down. By the time you arrived at your destination, a year may have passed aboard your ship, but 100 years may have passed for everyone else. This not only makes high speed travel difficult, it makes it impractical.</p>

    <h6>Breaking the Speed Limit Without Breaking the Laws of Physics</h6>
    <p>There are loopholes to this problem. this is where planar space come into play. Because planar space is fundamentally different than normal space, an object can move at speeds far in excess of the galactic speed limit of 185,000 miles per second.</p>
    <p>Plane space is composed of just 3 dimensions, height, width, and time. Plane space has no depth, meaning ordinary matter cannot exist in plane space, which I will explain in a little bit.</p>
    <p>The only particles that can exist in planar space are known as plane space particles. They are 2 dimensional particles the size of protons that drift through plane space. For the purposes of this article, I will refer to these particles as X Particles, although they are often referred to in the anime series as "plane space dust". Due to planar space only having 3 dimensions, normal matter would be crushed upon entering by immense gravity waves, much like a submarine will implode when it exceeds the maximum depth it's hull can withstand. Conversely, when an X Particle exits planar space, it is radiated out as white light, which is why an open sord looks like a small star. This immense pressure can only be overcome by the use of a space-time bubble generator, which generates a self-contained region of "normal" space, where 4 dimensions, and thus normal matter, can safely exist. Running this generator requires immense energy to overcome to force of the gravity waves trying to crush the field and convert ordinary mass into X Particles that can exist in plane space. Given the energy requirements, a ships' range is limited by the amount of anti-matter fuel it can carry.</p>

    <h6>Navigating a Blind Maze</h6>
    <p>Now that we have established the most basic concepts of planar space, we must move on to navigating planar space. It is important to remember that because plane space has only three dimensions, it is impossible for light to exist, as light is made up of photons, which have height, width, and depth. Also due to this fast it is impossible for radar sensors to operate in this environment. This is where the X Particles become critical. Without them, traveling into planar space would be suicide.</p>
    <p>When a Yuanon particle is closed, it attracts very few X Particles from its position between plane space and normal space. When a Yuanon is exploded into Sord Gulark state, it acts like a magnet, attracting X Particles from plane space, which exit into normal space and become light. The Abh and other advanced human races have developed sensors on their ships which can detect X Particles in plane space, and determine the location of the nearest sord, based on the density of the particles. When a ship enters a sord into planar space, the ship can detect other sords in close proximity, and determine it's route by the location of those sords in relation to one another. This allows a ship to have a limited sense of direction.</p>

    <h6>Problems with Navigating in Plane Space</h6>
    <p>Now we come to the problems with this form of travel. Since the only way to navigate in plane space is to use the X Particles to detect sords, it is possible to get lost in planar space. When a ship enters a sord from normal space into plane space, or vise versa, it is impossible to predict where the ship will emerge on the other side, and on what heading it will be traveling. for the purposes of this article, I will refer to this phenomenon as the Toilet Bowl Theory. Let us assume that the surface of the toilet water represents normal space, and the drain represents planar space. It is easy to predict where the plastic marble will enter the bowl, but it is impossible to calculate where the ball will exit, because the number of factors needed to calculate it's exit point are as numerous at the molecules of water in the bowl. The Toilet Bowl Theory means that when a fleet of ships enters or exits a sord, it is impossible to know where they will emerge o the other end, thus resulting in chaos. This presents a huge problem when entering plane space. If ships can not coordinate, a fleet of ships could be scattered across half the galaxy, as the range of navigational sensors in plane space is extremely limited. Once a ship leaves sensor range, no other ship in the fleet will be able to locate that ship. </p>
    <p>This is also a problem when exiting into normal space. The risk of collision with other ships is extremely high. In addition, any attack, such as a large scale mine attack on enemy vessels from plane space into normal space, will be hindered, due to the Toilet Bowl Theory. Objects, in this case mines, will exit on unpredictable paths, and may not exit anywhere near a target, or worse off, may exit and crash into a friendly target. To date, no race has been able to solve these problems.</p>

    <h6>Communication in Planar Space</h6>
    <p>Communication, like navigation, is also made possible by the existence of the X Particles.An Abh ship in close proximity to another can send pulses of X Particles toward another ship, which can be translated into data, like Morris Code. The problem with this, like with navigation, is that using this method of communication is limited in range and is slow.</p>
    <p>Communication at greater distances requires a probe or communications shuttle to be dispatched. This is more costly and time consuming, but allows a message to be delivered to a distant ship much faster.</p>

    <h6>Space-Time Bubbles and Generators</h6>
    <p>The space-time bubble generator (Flasath) is to the Abh, what Warp Drive is to Star Fleet. A space-time bubble generator works by creating an artificial region of normal space in which normal mass can exist. Due to the limited availability of translated resources, it is not currently known how exactly this piece of technology works. When such information becomes available, this article will be updated to reflect the new information.</p>
    <p>Space-time bubbles have two modes, stationary (Scobrtamh) and mobile (Noctamh). When a bubble enters the planar universe it must move from one point to another by rolling, much like a marble on a table. The direction and speed of roll can be manipulated. A ship can be slowed by switching between modes at a set ratio. A ship's maximum velocity is limited by it's mass. A more massive ship requires a larger bubble with more surface area. The same gravity waves which exert force on the bubble, also create resistence to movement. A larger bubble with more surface area can not move as fast because of this fact. A smaller ship with a smaller bubble can travel much faster, even if it's reactors are much less powerful, because it has less surface area, and thus requires less energy to roll.</p>
    <p>When two bubbles merge (Gor Ptarhot), it is impossible to predict at what angle one ship will be with respect to the other ship. For this same reason, when a ship exits into normal space, it could be facing any direction, even backwards. This in conjunction with the Toilet Bowl Theory means that having several ships exit a sord at the same time is extremely dangerous because of the unpredictability of where the ships will emerge and what angle they will be facing when they exit.</p>
    <p>Bubbles can also be shared to conserve energy and increase range. Multiple ships can share one bubble, increasing range, but reducing the maximum velocity.</p>

    <h6>Basics of the Yuanon Particle</h6>
    <p>Yuanons were first discovered around the sun by early explorers on the exploration ship Oort Cloud. A Yuanon is the size of a proton and radiates 500 megawatts of energy. Early explorers used these particles to power generational colony ships like the Leif Erickson. The Abh colony ship used eight Yuanons, some of which were acquired after they departed from the mother space city.</p>
    <p>Yuanons are always found in close proximity to stars, and are arranged in a series of twelve rings around the Milky Way galaxy. There are over 3 billion Yuanons in the galaxy, and each ring has an equal amount of Yuanons. The inner seven rings are controlled by the Four Nations Alliance, and the outer 5 rings are controlled by the Abh. At the center of the galaxy, Yuanons are packed so densely that it is impossible for a ship to navigate that region of space without getting lost. At the outer edge of the galaxy, a small cluster of Yuanons controlled by the Abh are believed to lead to other galaxies.</p>
    <p>In order to form an open sord, a Yuanon must be struck at near light speed by another particle. Such collisions rarely happen naturally, but can be achieved with the use of a particle accelerator. Once a Yuanon is open, it no longer radiates energy, but must be in close proximity to a star. Photons from the star enter the sord and keep it open. If a sord is moved away from a star, and no longer receives photons of light, it will revert to its natural state and radiate energy once more. </p>
