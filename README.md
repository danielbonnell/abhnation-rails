## About the Project
This is a semi-interactive mockup for the front-end of my breakable toy (final project for Launch Academy). The end product will be a refreshed version of the [original site](http://www.abhnation.com/) (sans a splash page), which was first launched on October 2nd, 2004. Development of The Abh Nation formally ceased on April 20th, 2009.

## Current Status
The site is currently live on [Heroku](http://abhnation.herokuapp.com/).

Currently implemented features:
* 1. Users can register, log in, edit their profile, and log out.

Additional features will be added to this list as they are implemented. 

## Goals
The primary goals of this project are to:
* 1. Deliver a fully functional release of the project by Janruary 26th, 2015;
* 2. Design a top-notch mobile-first interface that adheres to the design asthetics of the original site;
* 3. Develop a stable feature-rich backend using Ruby on Rails, ActiveRecord, PostgreSQL, JavaScript, JQuery UI, HTML5, and CSS3 best practices, and;
* 4. Have fun on the way!

## Features
Core features will include:
* 1. A design that is faithful to the aesthetics of the original site;
* 2. The ability for users to log in or register an account natively or through another site via OmniAuth;
* 3. The ability for users with administrative privileges to create, edit, or remove content from the site such as articles and image galleries;
* 4. The ability to restrict what content users can see when not logged it to the site, and;
* 5. A search feature.

Additional features will include (as time permits):
* 1. The ability to integrate the site with a forum software package such as Invision Power Board in the future, or;
* 2. A custom forum system built on rails.
