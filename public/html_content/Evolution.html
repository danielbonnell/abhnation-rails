    <h6>The Evolution of Baronh</h6>
    <p>The original settlers, who would become the Abh, spoke Japanese. But all languages evolve over the centuries. An example of how much the language has evolved would be to compare the name of the star system, which houses the capital city of Lacmhacarh. The name given to the system by the original Abh, was "Amataritsu", which, over the centuries, became Abl√Øarsec. Not only did the language evolve, but the alphabet also changed as well. Below are the Japanese Hiragana and Katakana Alphabet as they are today. Next to it is the Baron Alphabet as it is now.</p>

    <p>One can tell that many of the characters look similar to Japanese. You may also recognize some Russian, and American based letters in Baronh. It is likely that the Abh trading activities with other cultures influenced their language, but one can only speculate on such matters as such information is not currently known for certain.</p>
