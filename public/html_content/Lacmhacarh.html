    <h6>Nicknames</h6>
    <p>The capital city of the Abh empire has earned itself a legendary status, and is known by many nick names. Some of the nicknames are listed below.</p>

    <b>The Capital of Confusion</b>
    <p>This refers to the fact that Lacmhacarh is never in the same place, it’s many sections are constantly orbiting around the star in the Ablairsec system, like bees swarming around a hive, constantly changing positions.</p>

    <b>The Root of the Dragon Heads</b>
    <p>This nickname refers to the design of the base of the massive city, which spreads out into 8 arms, resembling the 8 heads of the Gaftonochec.</p>

    <b>The Falling Place</b>
    <p>This nickname refers to the capital city of an empire that will go to war even when all odds are against them. The capital has been under siege by enemy ships three times, but has never fallen.</p>

    <b>The Capital of Love</b>
    <p>This nickname refers to the fact that many Abh spend over hald their lives living in the capital city. In a society of only 35 million Abh that spreads over an entire galaxy, it is often difficult to have encounters with other Abh on other ships, so many Abh come to the capital to start a family or to look for a lover.</p>

    <b>Home</b>
    <p>It is where many Abh are born, and some return to die here amongst the stars.</p>

    <h6>Technical Data</h6>
    <p>Lacmhacarh is located in the Ablairsec star system, orbiting the star Ablairsec. The city was started when the Abh colony ship settled in the area and exploded it’s 8 yuanan particles to open 8 gateways in the same system. The Abh have constantly expanded the capital city, building on to it. The city now is comprised of numerous sections that orbit the sun. The Abh also built the largest anti-matter production facility in the known universe. From a distance it appears to be a fine mesh wrapped around the sun, but in reality, the fine threads are over 50 kilometers in width.</p>
    <p>The city that once only had enough room to house 200,000 Abh, is now home to over 2 million Abh, not counting all the visitors who travel there year round. It is the largest space city in the entire known universe.</p>
    <p>The main section of the city is over 300,000 kilometers in length and consists of residential areas, industrial facilities, and military ports where ships dock. The city orbits 60,000,000 kilometers from the sun. The eight gates orbit 1,000,000 kilometers further from the city and in the opposite directions. A fortress and ships heavily guard each gate.</p>
    <p>The city is perhaps the best defended in all of space, and has never fallen to any enemies.</p>
