    <h6>History of the Lubaréc</h6>
    <p>The Lubaréc is the Abh military machine, the military machine that controls half the Milky Way galaxy and keeps the peace, or wages war on the empire's enemies. The Abh were originally nomadic space traders and traveled aboard a single colony ship, the Ablïarsec. The highest rank at the time, was Hecto-Commander, and the Hecto-Commander made all the final decisions. Eventually the Abh population grew and the Abh were forced to build new ships and add new ranks to accommodate their needs. They added the rank of Deca-Commander, for someone who commanded two ships, and later Kilo-Commander, Commodore Admiral, Admiral, Fleet Admiral, Chief Admiral, and Imperial Admiral. As the empire expanded, the Star Forces expanded with it. More ships were needed to control an ever expanding empire. In Seikai no Senki, Ghintec comments that the Star Forces had reached a level of grandeur never before seen, as new fleets of ships were produced every month.</p>

    <h6>The Star Forces Army Division</h6>
    <p>As the empire expanded and added more planets to its domain, it was apparent that the Abh would need an army for ground operations. The exact date or time period in which the Abh Army begun, is not known. Eventually the army grew tired of taking orders from the Star Forces and rebelled. This rebellion was known as the Rebellion of Ghimrÿar, and led to a civil war. The Star Forces eventually prevailed and the army was disbanded, but not before the empire incurred great losses. The Abh still maintain a small ground division, but nothing capable of offensive operations. This division is seen in action at the end of Seikai no Senki II, when Painaich dispatches ground forces to rescue Ghintec from the revolting prisoners of Robnassar II. The division consists mainly of lightly armed soldiers with armored cars.</p>

    <h6>Service Requirements</h6>
    <p>Depending on social status, service in the Star Forces may or may not be voluntary. Members of royalty are required to serve 13 years in the Star Forces, including 3 years at a military academy. Additionally, members of royalty must serve in combat role. Members of nobility are also required to serve 13 years in the Star Forces, including 3 years in a military academy. However members of nobility are not required to serve in a combat role. Citizens and Nationals are not required to serve, however many serve out of a sense of duty to the empire. Many Nationals, or "landers" as they are commonly referred to, serve in the Star Forces for various reasons. Some aspire to become citizens of the empire, some aspire to leave their home planet. Most landers join for the adventure and benefits involved. Landers who lead a successful military career may be granted citizenship. The Star Forces is also known to pay its members a competitive salary, that is often far more than what can be earned in other jobs, especially on planets. Samsonn notes in Seikai no Senki that the Star Forces have compensated him extremely well for his service, and that he plans to retire after a few more battles.  </p>

    <h6>Ranking System</h6>
    <p>Like any military force, the Star Forces has a complex ranking system and a chain of command. When in the line of duty, military rank always overrides social rank. Thus even though Lamhirh is a Viscount, a social rank much higher than that of Citizen, she must still take orders from superior officers who rank higher in the military chain of command, but far lower in the social caste system.</p>
