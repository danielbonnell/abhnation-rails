    <h6>Introduction</h6>
    <p>This article briefly covers the Abh measurement system. The Abh measurement system is almost exactly the same as the metric system used in most of the world today.</p>

    <h6>Time</h6>
    <p>The Abh measure time much like we do, and follow the same format as the Gregorian Calendar. Abh time is broken down as follows.</p>

    <ul class="inline-list">
      <li>
        <ul>
          <li><b>*</b></li>
          <li>Earth</li>

          <li><b>Months</b></li>
          <li>12</li>

      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>*Each unit of time is divisible into the next. Seconds per minute, minutes per hour, etc.</p>
    <p>It should be noted that there is a slight variation between the Imperial Calendar and the Gregorian Calendar. On Earth, it is necessary to keep time according to the rotation of the Earth's axis and orbit around the sun. Therefore Leap Year was added. Every 4th year, one extra day would be added to keep time in sync. Since the Abh live in space, not on Earth, it was not necessary to have a Leap Year, so it was illuminated to simplify the system.</p>
    <p>The Imperial Calendar begun when the empire was established. The corresponding date in years AD (Ano Domini, Earth Gregorian Calendar), to the start of the Abh calendar is not known. The names of the months and days have also changed. This information is not available in English at the moment. When it becomes available, it will be posted here accordingly.</p>
    <p>It should also be noted that the Abh do not have Daylight Savings Time, or Time Zones. Individual planets have their own time and time zones according to their rotation and their own calendars according to their rotation around a star. The Abh have only one time, which applies to the entire empire. This eases communication and fleet coordination and makes business easier. </p>

    <h6>Distance, Weight, Volume</h6>
    <p>The Abh system of measurements is essentially the same as the Metric system in use in most countries on Earth. The names of prefixes have changed, but the units have not changed. Like the Metric system, the prefixes are always the same regardless of what is being measured. </p>

    <h6>Gravity</h6>
    <p>The Abh measure gravity using a unit of measure called a Daimon. Two Daimons are equivilant to one "G", or the Earth's gravity. Standard gravity on Abh ships is one Daimon, but when accelerating this can increase to as much as 50 Daimons, or 25 G's. Most planets have 2-3 Daimons, depending on mass and composition. </p>
