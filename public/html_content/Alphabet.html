    <h6>Introduction</h6>
    <p>This page contains a chart displaying the pronunciation of the letters, their roman equivalent letters, and the numbers. I did not use phonetic symbols on this chart. Most people are not linguists and thus will not know what they are. This page also contains a key map for the font set FRYBAReK2.TTF by Barmark 2000. This key map is designed for the FRYBAReK2.TTF font set only, and may or may not work with any other Baronh font sets. These charts may be redistributed without permission so long as credit is given in the manor specified by The Abh Nation's Copyright Notice. </p>
