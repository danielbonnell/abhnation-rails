    <h6>Introduction</h6>
    The following is a comprehensive list of character profiles for the Abh
    that have appeared in the animated version of the Seikai series. Characters
    are classified by their genetic race, not by their legal status. While
    Jinto is legally an Abh, he is not a genetic Abh, and thus is not included
    on this page.

    Lamhirh is the daughter of Placïac and Dubeusec, and granddaughter of the
    27th Empress Lamï, born in the Imperial Year 936. She served as a pilot
    trainee aboard the Gothlauth. Later in Seikai no Senki, she became captain
    of the Basrogrh, a small assault ship (Gairh). She is a very energetic
    person and very stubborn. She is about 5'5 with blue hair (obviously). Here
    eye-color has been widely debated between black and brown. She is very
    close to Ghintec but being a stubborn Ablïarsec, she refuses to admit it

    Hecto-Commander Placïac is the captain of the Gothlauth and also the gene
    donor of Lamhirh, making Lamhirh a daughter of love. Not much is known
    about her because she is killed early on when a squad of enemy attack ships
    destroyed the Gothlauth. She is a main character in the OVA (Original Video
    Animation) Seikai no Danshou Tanjo (Crest of the Stars - Birth). She has
    golden-yellow eyes, is tall, and has a very laid back, yet strict
    personality. She played some role in bringing Lamhirh and Ghintec together,
    although the details of this have been widely speculated, the topic has not
    come up in any canon source such as the novels or anime series.

    Sobach appears quite young although he is in his 50's. Sobach is the
    Head-Flyer on the Basrogrh and a very wealthy Abh businessmen. He holds a
    low rank in the Lubaréc because he spent his early years on business trips.
    Even by Abh standards he is very wealthy. He has black eyes and is very
    reserved. The Anime series portrays him as a woman, but he is in fact, a
    man. In the novels he is described as having facial hair and a deep voice,
    however the animators accidentally animated him as a female. Due to budget
    restrictions this mistake was not reversed, and his voice-over was
    performed by a female.

    Painaich is a Rear Admiral in the Lubaréc and comes from a high-class Abh
    family. She tends to be somewhat snobby and arrogant at times. Although she
    appears to not care weather her ships are lost or not, she is in fact, one
    of the better admirals in the Lubaréc. Her eyes are the same color red as
    her flag ship. She particularly enjoys teasing her Chief-of-Staff, Cfadiss.
    She is also known to have exotic pet birds. She spends a good portion of
    her time complaining of her endless boredom and planning her own funeral
    service.

    more reasonable strategies, proposed by his Chief-of-Staff. He makes rash
    decisions based on skeptical evidence and is very hot headed. He has
    grayish-black eyes and holds the rank of Admiral. There is not much to say
    of him as he does not play a critical role in the series and is only seen
    for a brief time at the ending of Seikai no Monshou and in Seikai no Senki.
