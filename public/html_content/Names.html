    <h6>Introduction</h6>
    <p>An Abh name is comprised of 5 parts, a clan name, a family title, a family name, their title (if they have one), and their given name.</p>

    <h6>Clan Name</h6>
    <p>A clan consists of multiple Abh families. There are 29 clans. Clan names are very rarely changed, and are usually passed down along with the family name. Even though some Abh may carry the same clan name, it doesn't necessarily mean that they are related. In the case of the imperial family though, members who are not in the ruling family are not allowed to continue carrying the name Ablïarsec. They are instead assigned a new clan name. Therefore the Ablïarsec clan has only one family, which is currently the Dubleuscr family. However if someone were to rise to the level of Imperial Admiral in the Star Forces, as Dusanh has done, they become next in line, and therefore that person becomes part of the Ablïarsec clan.</p>

    <h6>Family Title and Name</h6>
    <p>All family names start with a title. There are six titles. A family title classifies that family's social rank. Those titles and ranks are charted below.</p>

    <p>*Someone who is from one of the 29 founding clans would have this title. Which title they have would depend on their family name.</p>
    <p>**Abh Nationals, humans who have attained citizenship, can serve in the Star Forces and be promoted to Nobility for an outstanding career. this was the case of the Former Baron Feubdach, who served in the Star Forces and was given the Feubdach territory. </p>
    <p>An Abh doesn't need a territory to have noble status. An Abh can be promoted to nobility for service in the Star Forces, even if they're no territories to give them. </p>

  <div class="large-24 medium-24 small-24 columns">
    <h6>Title</h6>
    <p>Abh names also consist of a title; depending whether or not the person has a title. If the person does have a title, then it would come after his/her family name. <i>Example: Ablïarsec Néïc Dubleuscr Boerh Parhynr Lamhirh.</i></p>
    <p>This is Lamhirh's full name. In her name, Boerh is her title. Boerh or "Viscount" means that she has a territory under her name. So she is a noble like Ghintec. In this case though, Ghintec is a higher-ranking noble than Lamhirh. His title is Dreur (Earl). This means he has an inhabited planet in his territory. Lamhirh however, doesn't have an inhabited planet in her territory. But she can be promoted to Earl if the second planet were to be terraformed and populated. Even if an Abh doesn't have a territory, he/she can still be promoted to nobiliy and have a title. A title does not neccesarily mean you have a territorial claim. In this case, a title can not be passed on, because it is not connected with a territory.</p>

    <h6>Given Name</h6>
    <p>A given name is the name given to an Abh at birth by his/her parent(s). A given name always comes last, because it is the least important and is not associated with any social ranking.</p>

    <h6>Royal Families and Kingdoms</h6>
    <p>It should be noted that Kingdom name never appears in the name of a member of royalty. There are eight kingdoms of the Abh empire. Each family rules one of the kingdoms.</p>

    <p>*Spelling of Family Name conflicts with established canon. It is possible these are the original spellings, and the canon spelling of the names is the version that evolved over 950+ years, however that is just speculation.</p>

    <h6>Name Structure Analysis</h6>
    <p>Now that we have established how the Abh naming system works, its time to figure out some more information about the Abh. By visiting the Abh Profiles page, you can pick any name of any character, and analyze it to get some basic information about that character.</p>
    <p>
      Example 1. Lets find out some information about Painaich's background.
      <br />
      <i>Clan - Family Title - Family Name - Rank - Title - Given Name</i>
      <br />
      <b>Spaurh Aronn Saicspath Nimh Laitpanr Painaich</b>
    </p>
    <p>So we can now find out that Painaich is from the Spaurh clan. Her family, Saicspath, is of noble descent, and she is the Great Duchess of Laitpanr.</p>

    <p>
      Example 2. Lets find out some information about Naurh's background.
      <br />
      <i>Clan - Family Title - Family Name - Rank - Title - Given Name</i>
      <br />
      <b>Aicryac Üémh Tlyzr Naurh</b>
    </p>
    <p>Now remember that the ordering is important. If you remember how names are written, you will realize that Naurh has no title and is not of nobility. From her name we find that she is from the Aicryac clan, and her family, Tlyzr is one of the original 29 founding families of the empire, and her given name is Naurh.</p>

    <p>Now try a few examples on your own. Please note that human names do not conform to any system, since the humans in the series are from a variety of planets with different cultures and customs. If you are feeling brave, try and make your own Abh name, its easy!</p>
