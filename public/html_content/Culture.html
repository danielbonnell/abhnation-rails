    <h6>The Extra Sensory Organ</h6>
    <p>This is an organ comprised of over 100 million microscopic eyes. It is the shape of a diamond located in the top middle of the forehead and enables the Abh to "sense" everything going on around them. It is not the same as a fly's 360 degree vision. The vision is closer to radar than anything else. An Abh could know someone is behind them, but they would not know who it it was. An Abh can wear a special Tiara that interfaces with the extra sensory organ and connects to the ship's computer, allowing them to sense and feel everything the ship senses and feels. It is believes that landing a punch on top of the organ would kill most Abh by means of blunt trama.</p>

    <h6>Kin of the Stars</h6>
    <p>The Abh refer to themselves as the "Kin of the Stars". The name suites them well, as they are the only space-faring race of people. All the other people in the universe live on planets and few travel into space. While on the other hand, the vast majority of Abh are born in space and live their entire life space. Most Abh have never set foot on a planet. In addition to living 200-250 years, Abh age like humans do until they are about 25.  They refer to this stage of life as their "growth" period. After reaching 25 they no longer exhibit physical signs of aging ever again. This stage of life is referred to as "maturation".</p>

    <h6>Abh Personality Traits</h6>
    <p>Abh take great pride in how they act in public and how they conduct themselves. Contrary to what most people would think, the Abh do not take much pride in their appearance. It is not because they are ungrateful of who they are, but because personality and good conduct are more important to them. Any Abh would rather be called "elegant", than "lovely", or "beautiful". Abh are very practical people. They always like to "asses" a situation and enter it prepared. They do not like fighting, or having wars. They try to avoid battle unless it is unavoidable. While many humans consider the Abh reckless and arrogant, nothing is further from the truth. An example of such practicality was seen in Seikai no Monshou, when Admiral Laimsairh prior to the Battle of Sfagnaumh Gateway. He was concerned to go into battle even though he had a tremendous advantage over the enemy.</p>

    <h6>Abh Genetics</h6>
    <p>When Abh have children, they must go through the genetic manipulation process to ensure 100% genetic purity. Usually the child is born from an artificial uterus but some Abh women prefer the natural method of reproduction. Most women do not carry the embryo of the unborn child, instead it is placed in a gestation machine  until maturity, however there are rare exceptions. The Abh children are often referred to as "The Art of Genetic Manipulation". When te genes of the embryo are modified, they are rechecked many hundreds, or even thousands of times to ensure genetic purity. There are two primary reasons for this. The first reason, which is purely cultural, is that the Abh do not wish to be subject to evolution. The Abh wish to preserve their genetic makeup, unlike the human race, whose genetic makeup is constantly evolving over time. In this way the Abh have removed themselves from the evolutionary process. The second reason for this genetic tampering is a result of the first reason. Because the Abh all have nearly identical genetic makeup, their race has lost it's genetic diversity. Unlike the human gene pool, which is comprised of a wide variety of physical traits, the Abh have very little diversity, making healthy and natural reproduction nearly impossible. The odds of two Abh having a natural unmodified child that is healthy are about 1 in 10. The odds of a human and an Abh having a healthy child without genetic modification are 1 in 50, mainly because of the genetic differences between the two races. Thus Abh law requires a parent to have their child's genes checked and stabilized. It is not required by law to modify the child;s genes to exhibit their family traits, however it is social taboo to bypass this step. Lamhirh is a rare exception, where the parent(s) of a child choose not to modify their child's genes. The Abh are master geneticists and have engineered their DNA to eliminate disease and greatly slow aging. They have also adapted their bodies for a life in space. They can survive in zero gravity, and withstand extreme acceleration, comparable to 50 Daimons (25 times greater than Earth's natural gravity). Even the most physically conditioned humans can only withstand about 20 Daimons (10 times greater than Earth's natural gravity). The most notable of their adaptations include their 250 year lifespan, blue hair, and their extra sensory organ.</p>
