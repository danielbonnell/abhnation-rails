    <h6>Who is an Abh?</h6>
    <p>The word Abh has three meanings. A genetic Abh is a person with the genetic makeup dissimilar to human genetic makeup. An Abh typically has blue hair, and always has an extra sensory organ in their forehead. An Abh is also someone who is a knight, peerage, or royalty.</p>

    <p>
      <b>Knight</b>: A person who serves in the Star Forces is a knight.
      <br />
      <b>Peerage</b>: A member of nobility, ranging from the lowest ranking Baron to wealthy Kings and Queens.
      <br />
      <b>Royalty</b>: A member of the royal family, in particular, any Abh with the family name Ablïarsec, is of royal descent.
    </p>

    <p>An Abh is also someone who is genetically human, but has attained legal status and an Abh, most often through becoming a citizen of the empire, but in some exceptional cases, by becoming Nobility, as is the case with Ghintec's father, Rock Linn.</p>

    <h6>The Caste System</h6>
    <p>Abh society is set up in a traditional caste system, very similar to that used in many cultures on Earth in the past. At the very top of the pyramid, is the royal family. Below them, are the nobles, from the higher ranking Kings, Queens, Princes, Princess, and Earls, to the lower ranking nobility. Below the nobility are the knights, members of the Star Forces. Below the Knights are the citizens. At the bottom of the pyramid are the Abh subjects, humans living on planets who are not legally Abh, but are under the rule of the empire. There are about 35 million Abh, and 960 billion humans in the empire. Below is a chart with the social rankings from highest to lowest. In the Abh language Baronh, no gender is associated with one's social role. This is why there is only one word for king/queen, empress/emperor, etc.</p>

    <p>**Vassals are not lower in rank than subjects. Vassals unlike subjects, directly serve their noble, whereas subjects are under the rule of their noble, but do not serve the noble or his/her household directly.</p>

    <h6>Abh Classes and Ranks</h6>
    <p>The empire is made up of eight royal families. At the head of each of these families is a king or queen. They each have their respective territories, which make up the empire. Below the kings and queens, are the nobles and knights. Each noble has his/her own territory, which make up the family's territory. Nobles with no territory eared their rank through service in the Star Forces. There are different ranks for nobles.</p>
    <p>A Baron has no habitable planet or planet that could be terraformed in his/her territory. Therefore, a Baron has no chance of being promoted. However, a Viscount does have planet(s) in his/her territory. So if a Viscount were to have their planet terraformed and populated, they can be promoted to the rank of Earl. If their planets' population reaches more than 100 million, then they will be promoted to the rank of Marquees.</p>
    <p>Abh citizens also have ranks. There are nationals and subjects. The difference between a subject and a national is that a subject is controlled by his/her ruler. As an example, the Baron Feubdach's vassals are subjects. In the case of the subject, the empire has no authority to interfere with the relationship between the subject and their ruler. However on the other hand, a national is under the rule of the empire, not a noble. Although, a subject may join the Star Field Navy and become a national. If a subject becomes a national, then they are legally an Abh. When a noble is a prince or princess, this doesn't mean they are related to the empress, or have any royal roots at all. This simply means that they are next in line for the position of noble. As an example, prior to the execution of Rock Linn, Earl of Martine, Ghintec was the Count of Martine. A Count is the son or daughter, or whoever is next in for a position of nobility. A prince or princess is the same as a count, except they will inherit their family's territory, rather than a territory ruled by a lesser noble.</p>
