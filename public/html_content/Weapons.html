    <h6>Mines</h6>
    <p>Space-Time mines are essentially missiles that are launched from a ship and can either attack a target immediately, defend the ship against other mines, or be left behind to destroy an unsuspecting enemy ship. Mines are fueled by anti-matter fuel and contain an anti-matter warhead. In order to avoid accidents and leaks, mines are not fueled until they are ready to be deployed in battle. Abh mines are about four times the size of a school bus, and a direct hit will severely damage larger ships, and destroy smaller ships. Mines used by the United Mankind are somewhat smaller and can split up into several smaller mines. In order to avoid being shot down, United Mankind mine can split up when an a laser beam approaches the mine. The smaller fragments have been known to go undetected, and activate to attack unsuspecting Abh ships.</p>

    <h6>Electromagnetic Rail Cannons</h6>
    <p>Electromagnetic Rail cannons, or EM cannons utilize a system of magnets that switch on and off at a rapid rate to accelerate projectiles to high speeds. The Abh EM cannons fire nuclear fusion warheads at 1/100th the speed of light. These warheads are much harder to outrun than slow moving mines, and use small thrusters to adjust their course after being launched. A single fusion round can destroy a smaller ship or critically damage a larger ship. A single nuclear fusion round, if fired into a planet's atmosphere can cause enough damage to render the planet uninhabitable. Patrol ships are equipped with 4 forward firing cannons and 2 aft firing cannons. The Abh recently developed a new cross between an attack ship and a patrol ship, which has two forward firing cannons. Most flag ships also have an array of these cannons. United Mankind patrol ships are equipped with these cannons as well.</p>

    <h6>Anti-Proton Cannons</h6>
    <p>Anti-proton cannons fire concentrated bursts of negatively charged protons, which build up as a result of the ships nuclear fusion reactors. Normally these particles are discarded into space, but they can be used as a weapon in battle. Anti-proton cannons are highly effective against mines, and in large numbers, can be effective against larger ships. Assault ships are equipped with one anti-proton cannon.</p>

    <h6>Ion Cannons</h6>
    <p>Ion cannons are the weakest of all the weapons in use by the Star Forces. They are purely defensive, and all Abh ships, except Line-of-Battle ships are equipped with them. They are useful against mines, and unshielded shuttle craft. They work by firing a dense stream of ions at near-light speed.</p>

    <h6>Laser Cannons</h6>
    <p>These cannons work by firing a beam of concentrated infrared light at a target to cause heat damage. They have marginal effectiveness against mines or unshielded shuttle craft. they are not used on war ships, as they have absolutely no effect.</p>

    <h6>Energy Shields</h6>
    <p>Abh war ships employ energy shields that deflect particle weapons to a certain extent. Shield on larger ships will deflect a great deal of particle weapons fire, but smaller ships have very limited shield strength. Shields on even the largest ships afford no protection against mines or projectile weapons, such as EM cannons.</p>

    <h6>Hull Plating</h6>
    <p>All Abh ships must have this. On smaller ships, hull plating is only a few inches thick, and affords only limited protection against particle weapons. On larger ships, thick hull plating can greatly reduce damage from fusion rounds or mines.</p>
